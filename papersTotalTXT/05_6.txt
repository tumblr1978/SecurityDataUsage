1 Introduction

Virtual Coordinate Systems (VCS) have been proposed
as an efﬁcient and low cost service to provide network lo-
cality estimations by accurately predicting round-trip times
(RTT) between arbitrary nodes in a network. Each node
measures the RTT to a small number of other nodes and
then can estimate the RTT between any two nodes. VCSs
assign a set of coordinates to each node based on the esti-
mated RTTs and a distance function. In a distributed and
decentralized VCS, like Vivaldi [2], each node maintains
and updates its own coordinate by relying on information
received from other nodes.

Distributed VCSs have been shown [3] to be extremely
vulnerable to insider attacks, where compromised nodes de-
lay measurement probes and lie about their coordinates with
the motivation to decrease system performance. As many
applications rely on a VCS to build robust services, there
have been several proposals to secure them using anomaly
detection. However, these schemes are vulnerable to attacks
where through small changes attackers make the defense
mechanisms to learn malicious behavior as being good be-
havior. One such attack is the well-known frog-boiling at-
tack where attackers lie by small amounts that accumulate
over time and gradually lead to large changes in system per-
formance [1].

2 Description of Newton

A classical approach in designing distributed systems
is to use safety invariants in order to ensure system cor-
rectness. These safety invariants specify states into which
the distributed system should never enter. At ﬁrst glance,
VCS do not appear to have such invariants as minimal con-
straints are imposed. We make the key observation that
Vivaldi [2] is built upon an abstraction of a mass-spring
system and therefore all nodes must follow physical laws.
These laws are universal truths so they represent invariants
that all nodes in Vivaldi should globally follow. In particu-
lar, we derive three invariants (IN1, IN2, and IN3) that are
based on Newton’s three laws of motion.
IN1: If the centroid is not at the origin, then an attacker, has

introduced an unbalanced force that has the same direction
as a force vector from the origin to the centroid (~c).
IN2: Nodes i and k are physically close and if node i ex-
periences a force ~fij from node j, then node i would expect
node k to experience a force from j similar to the vector
projection of ~fij onto the vector u(xj − xk).
IN3: As the springs in the physical system stabilize and
come closer to their rest position, nodes should decelerate
and thus also the forces that are applied to them should de-
crease over time.

3 Results

We implement Newton, a decentralized VCS which ex-
tends Vivaldi to withstand a wide class of insider attacks.
When an update sent by a node violates an invariant, the re-
cipient simply discards the update. We run experiments on
Planetlab with 500 nodes. In Fig. 1(a) we ﬁnd that Newton
performs 25% better than Vivaldi in benign settings. We
also ﬁnd that Newton is able to mitigate the advanced frog-
boiling attack in Fig. 1(b) even under 30% of attackers.
