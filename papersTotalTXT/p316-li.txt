ABSTRACT
VoLTE (Voice-over-LTE) is the designated voice solution to the
LTE mobile network, and its worldwide deployment is underway. It
reshapes call services from the traditional circuit-switched telecom
telephony to the packet-switched Internet VoIP. In this work, we
conduct the ﬁrst study on VoLTE security before its full rollout. We
discover several vulnerabilities in both its control-plane and data-
plane functions, which can be exploited to disrupt both data and
voice in operational networks. In particular, we ﬁnd that the adver-
sary can easily gain free data access, shut down continuing data
access, or subdue an ongoing call, etc. We validate these proof-
of-concept attacks using commodity smartphones (rooted and un-
rooted) in two Tier-1 US mobile carriers. Our analysis reveals that,
the problems stem from both the device and the network. The de-
vice OS and chipset fail to prohibit non-VoLTE apps from access-
ing and injecting packets into VoLTE control and data planes. The
network infrastructure also lacks proper access control and runtime
check.

INTRODUCTION

Voice is a simple utility service, yet vital to both mobile operators
and phone users. It has been a killer application to mobile networks
for decades. As the infrastructure upgrades to Long Term Evolution

is also going through its fast evolution. This solution to the 4G
network is called VoLTE (Voice over LTE).

In a nutshell, VoLTE is a Voice-over-IP (VoIP) scheme for the
packet-switched (PS)-only, all-IP based LTE network [5]. It aban-
dons the circuit-switched (CS), legacy call solution to 2G/3G net-
works. The design appears straightforward. It carries voice mes-
sages in IP packets on the data plane, no longer through the dedi-
cated circuit. To facilitate the voice communication, each VoLTE
call also maintains a separate signaling session on the control plane.
This is akin to VoIP over the Internet. However, VoLTE adopts
cellular-speciﬁc techniques to ensure carrier-grade quality. It lever-
ages high-priority, quality-of-service (QoS) offered by the LTE net-
work for both signaling and voice data sessions.

Consequently, VoLTE offers clear beneﬁts over its legacy 2G/3G
call service, including improved quality (e.g., crystal-clear calls via
high-ﬁdelity codecs), more options (e.g., video calling, voicemail
and conferencing), and better interoperability (e.g., over mobile
networks, WiFi and the wired Internet). It is thus mandatory and
designated as the ultimate call solution [5]. As VoLTE shifts its
design paradigm from CS to PS, we are interested in whether such
substantial changes would possibly imperil the LTE network, as
well as mobile users.

In this work, we examine whether VoLTE exposes new and un-
expected threats. Our study stems from a simple rule of thumb
in that any major change is probably a source for insecurity. With
the nontrivial changes from CS to PS in its core technology, VoLTE
may interfere with other system components, thereby inducing new
loopholes. Technology-wise, we suspect that identical, PS-based
operations for voice and data may open the door to run data over
VoLTE. Moreover, as IP forwarding is easily accessible by the mo-
bile OS, VoLTE extends the rigid CS access within the device chipset
(hardware), to the more open PS access in software (OS and mo-
bile apps). This likely invalidates the existing protection mecha-
nisms and security defenses for traditional voice. Last, different
from normal data services, VoLTE has higher priority in resource
allocation to ensure better quality. It may inadvertently act as the
side-channel to leak critical information.

Our study conﬁrms all above suspicions. VoLTE may disrupt
both data and voice. First, the VoLTE control session can be abused
to carry PS data packets, beyond voice signaling messages. More
threateningly, with no billing upon VoLTE control packets, this ex-
ploitation leads to free data access. Such free service is available
to both Mobile-to-Internet and Mobile-to-Mobile communications.
Furthermore, the control-plane exploitation empowers higher-priority,
yet undeserved data access. This shuts down progressing data ses-

sions (data DoS), or imposes data overcharges on the victim. Sec-
ond, VoLTE is prone to new voice DoS attacks. An unprivileged
malware can mute an ongoing call when the session information is
leaked from the side channels on the data plane or improper coor-
dination between both data and control planes. Table 1 summarizes
our ﬁndings, which are conﬁrmed in two top-tier US carriers. We
further propose remedies on both control and data planes, both de-
vice and network sides to secure VoLTE.

The identiﬁed root causes are also multi-faceted. The mobile
technology standards, the device OS and hardware, and the net-
work operations all contribute to the security weakness. First, mo-
bile standards offer loose regulations to operations on both control
and data planes. VoLTE carries both its control signaling and voice
message over IP packets. However, both planes can be tricked to
transmit or receive non-VoLTE packets. The mobile technology
standards do not stipulate mechanisms to permit only authentic
voice packets in VoLTE. Second, mobile devices cannot prohibit
unintended access to VoLTE. Software and hardware rely on each
other for protection. Non-VoLTE apps gain access via software to
VoLTE, thus injecting packets into the hardware chipset. Mean-
while, the hardware always trusts the trafﬁc coming from the soft-
ware (OS and apps) and allows it to pass on without due check.
Consequently, the device should also share the blame. Third, net-
work operations should also be held accountable. The carrier trusts
mobile devices (in fact, their chipsets), and proper defense on the
network side is not entirely enforced.

In summary, we conduct the ﬁrst empirical study on VoLTE in-
security by systematically considering all the dimensions: control
plane, data plane, and their coordination. We further conﬁrm our
ﬁndings over two US carriers. The paper makes three contributions.

1. We identify seven vulnerabilities on its control plane, data
plane and coordination between both. They span mobile de-
vices (hardware and software) and carrier networks, rang-
ing from access control, billing policy, to QoS schemes and
VoLTE operations.

2. We devise proof-of-concept attacks (e.g., free data access,
data overcharging, data and voice DoS attacks) to exploit
identiﬁed vulnerabilities. We assess their impact in opera-
tional networks.

3. We deduce root causes, recommend solutions, and share the
learnt lessons. The mobile Internet industry is likely to ben-
eﬁt from such lessons, since it is still at its early stage for
full-ﬂedged, worldwide VoLTE deployment. Note that the
security of control and data planes is a generic problem for
different network services. The exposed issues and learned
lessons from VoLTE can also be applied to them.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. §2 gives the back-
ground of VoLTE, its potential vulnerabilities, and the attack model
of this work. In §3 and §4, we disclose vulnerabilities of VoLTE and
sketch attacks in terms of VoLTE control and data planes, respec-
tively. We then propose recommended ﬁx in §5, discuss several re-
maining issues in §6, updates ongoing efforts to ﬁx these problems

2. NEW SECURITY ISSUES WHEN VOLTE

TURNS VOICE INTO “DATA”

In this section, we ﬁrst review VoLTE and then identify its poten-
tial vulnerabilities. We describe the attack model and our assess-
ment methodology.
2.1 VoLTE Primer

VoLTE is projected as the primary voice solution to the LTE
users. It migrates the legacy, circuit-switched (CS) voice service
to the packet-switched (PS) design.
Network architecture for VoLTE.
Figure 1 depicts a simpliﬁed
architecture to support VoLTE. Two subsystems are involved. The
ﬁrst is the PS delivery subsystem (top), which exists before VoLTE
is enabled. Its role is to offer the PS connectivity to and from mo-
bile devices, thus accommodating versatile data services. The core
component is the 4G gateway, which forwards packets, akin to edge
routers in the Internet. It also provides certain control utilities such
as policy enforcement and data volume billing. The second is the
IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS, bottom), which supports IP tele-
phony and multimedia services [9]. It consists of two key elements:
the media gateway and the signaling server. The former is to deliver
multimedia (e.g., voice) trafﬁc to VoLTE users or traditional tele-
phony users. The latter is to perform call control functions among
the device, the media gateway and the 4G gateway.
How VoLTE works?
As illustrated in Figure 1, each VoLTE
call requires two communication sessions. The control-plane ses-
sion is to exchange the call signaling messages through the popular

317Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [30]; it is established and remains
active as long as the VoLTE feature is on. The data-plane session
handles the voice packet delivery, e.g., via the Internet Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) [6]; it is established on demand by the
control session. Note that no dedicated communication channel
(circuit) is reserved between the caller and the callee.
Instead,
all the voice trafﬁc and signaling messages are carried in packets
and delivered over IP. As a result, the 4G gateway not only relays
data packets to/from the Internet for ordinary mobile broadband
services, but also routes packets on both control and data planes
between the device and the IMS core.

To ensure carrier-grade call quality, VoLTE leverages the multi-
ple service classes (e.g., the guaranteed bit rate and different priori-
ties [8]) offered by LTE. Its data plane is carried by the guaranteed-
bit-rate class, which assures the lowest bit rate. Its control plane
uses the non-guaranteed-bit-rate category, but with the highest pri-
ority. In both cases, VoLTE signaling and voice are delivered with
higher priority than data services.
2.2 Potential Vulnerabilities

Ultimately, voice and data operate in the same, connection-less
IP network. However, this paradigm shift is double-edged, expos-
ing LTE networks and users to unanticipated vulnerabilities.

In this paper, we look into three security aspects.
1. How to trick VoLTE to gain PS data access, despite its des-
ignated role for voice? Technically, this relates to the access
control fences to VoLTE at the device and the network.

2. How to learn private, critical information on voice calls from
VoLTE? Note that VoLTE is IP based and more open and
accessible than the legacy CS call service.

3. Will the voice-related policies and operations (e.g., voice billing

and QoS control) work well in the VoLTE context? If not,
what are the imposed threats to LTE?

Our study covers three aspects of VoLTE operations: control-
plane, data-plane, and the coordination between control and data
planes. Such security issues span the device, the 4G Gateway and
the IMS core. In the following sections, we disclose how the cur-
rently employed or newly developed mechanisms fail to harden
VoLTE against attacks and how they are exploited to menace data
services (§3) and voice calls (§4).
2.3 Attack Model and Methodology

The presumed attacker is a mobile user, whereas the victims can
be the network operator or/and other mobile users. The adversary
uses a commodity smartphone rooted to gain full programability.
However, (s)he has no remote access, at least no privileged access
to the victim phones. In some attacks (i.e., data DoS, overbilling
and voice DoS), an unprivileged malware is required to monitor
basic activities and information (e.g., when the data transfer starts
and the IP information of network interfaces) on the victim phones.
The voice DoS also requires the malware to generate spam trafﬁc.
In all cases, the attacker has no control over the carrier network.
The network is not compromised.

To validate vulnerabilities and attacks, we conduct experiments
in two top-tier US carriers denoted as OP-I and OP-II1. They to-
gether represent almost 50% of market share. We use two An-
droid phone models that support VoLTE: Samsung Galaxy S5 and
LG G3, running Android 4.4.4 and 4.4.2, respectively. Note that
VoLTE functions on only a few recent models, because it requires
phone hardware and software upgrades (its rollout in US started in

them to ﬁx the identiﬁed issues.

2014). Both rooted and unrooted ones are tested. We focus on the
Android OS but we believe that the identiﬁed issues are applica-
ble to any other OS. The results also apply to both carriers unless
explicitly speciﬁed.

We bear in mind that some feasibility tests and attack evaluations
might be detrimental to users or operators. Therefore, we conduct
this study in a responsible manner through two measures. First,
we use only our own phones as the victims. Second, in those tests
beneﬁcial to mobile users (e.g., free data access), we carry out ex-
periments without exploiting them for real beneﬁt. Speciﬁcally, for
each phone, the total volume of free data services we test is always
less than that of data plan we have. We seek to disclose VoLTE vul-
nerabilities and effective attacks, but not to aggravate the damages.
We do not claim that the attacks are not the most powerful ones to
make damage.

3. PERPETRATING MOBILE DATA SERVICE

IN VOLTE CONTROL PLANE

The ﬁrst uncovered problem is that VoLTE can be exploited to
carry mobile data service, which is unintended by its designers.
VoLTE is developed to support calls but it is not restricted to voice
in operation. PS is employed to exchange VoLTE signaling mes-
sages on the control plane. However, it has not been hardened
against access to non-VoLTE trafﬁc (i.e., normal PS data service).
We discover that this can be indeed tricked to sustain two forms
of Mobile-to-Internet and Mobile-to-Mobile data access in opera-
tional networks. More threateningly, the billing scheme and quality
control for VoLTE can be abused to endanger LTE networks and
users. In the former, such unintended data access can bypass its
due charges, thereby yielding free data service, or result in over-
billing at victims. In the latter, it unjustly gains the highest priority
assigned to VoLTE signaling. It can be further manipulated for a
DoS attack against normal data service.
3.1 Carrying Data In VoLTE Signaling

While VoLTE intends to use PS packets to carry signaling mes-
sages, it is never forbidden from turning PS data into VoLTE (sig-
naling). Similar to the data service that retains a bearer (i.e., IP con-
nectivity), VoLTE also has a signaling bearer for its control-plane
operation. As shown in Figures 2a and 2b, both need to ﬁrst acti-
vate a bearer and obtain an IP connectivity within the LTE network.
Afterwards, data packets can be delivered through this bearer once
any service starts. The device sets the source address as that allo-
cated by the 4G Gateway and the destination as the target host’s.
For VoLTE, upon any call request, SIP messages are exchanged be-
tween the device and the IMS core through the signaling bearer. It
then on-demand invokes a voice bearer to carry conversation traf-
ﬁc if the call is accepted. When the call ends, the voice bearer is
released.

With the packet-carrying capability, it is feasible to carry any
data through the VoLTE signaling bearer under two vulnerabilities.
First, on the device side, there is no access control to prevent non-
VoLTE packets from being injected into the signaling bearer (V1).
Second, on the network side, these injected packets are allowed to
pass by (e.g., routed to the destination by the 4G gateway, V2).

V1: Lack of Access Control at Phone Software & Hardware

Access control on the control plane is to ensure its exclusive use
by authentic VoLTE signals. However, we discover that the device
lacks bullet-proof access control to the VoLTE control plane. Fig-
ure 3 shows the current practice on the mobile device. We also plot
the one for the CS voice for comparisons.

Figure 3: VoLTE Access control on the device side.

There are two options for access control at the phone: hard-
ware (i.e., 4G/3G chipset) and software (i.e., OS and apps) based.
For CS calls, all signals are handled within the chipset, never ex-
posed to OS and apps. There is no easy way to hijack them un-
less the hardware is compromised or special debugging mode is
invoked by developers.
In contrast, the VoLTE signaling access
is exposed to the mobile OS, where a network interface, called
VoLTE interface, is created for VoLTE only. There are a variety
of reasons to take the software approach: VoLTE adopts the Inter-
net protocols (IP and SIP) that are well supported in the OS (e.g.,
android.net.sip.* library); the software scheme offers high
ﬂexibility (e.g., easy upgrades) and rich information for the OS and
apps to optimize performance. By design, only genuine signals can
traverse the VoLTE interface and enter the underlying chipset.

However, the VoLTE interface has not been hardened against
non-authorized access. Other unprivileged apps can easily obtain
the VoLTE interface information, as they do to the mobile data in-
terface (see Figure 4 (left) for a two-interface example where IPv6
is used). In fact, information can be directly retrieved from the net
settings in the OS. For example, the IP address is obtained from
/proc/net/if_inet6, and the signaling server’s IP address
from the routing table (/proc/net/ipv6_route). Moreover,
it is feasible for the adversary to inject non-VoLTE data packets
(the red dashed lines in Figure 3). The attacker without root privi-
lege can specify its destination to any of the VoLTE-related servers.
Given the default routing table with rules to them, unprivileged
apps may inject packets into the VoLTE signaling bearer, and such
packets are routed to those VoLTE servers. With root privilege, the
adversary can add a routing rule to any destination for the VoLTE
interface. He is thus able to inject packets to any target via the
signaling bearer.

Note that we test all three popular types of trafﬁc in the empirical
studies of this section: UDP, TCP, and ICMP. The exposed vulner-
abilities may only exist for certain protocols and ports. We use one
type of trafﬁc to show the feasibility of each vulnerability. All the
other types of trafﬁc are considered to have similar results if not
explicitly speciﬁed.
Empirical validation. We conﬁrm the above vulnerability through
the following tests. First, an unprivileged app can obtain the inter-
face for the VoLTE signaling bearer (rmnet1), as well as the one
for PS data (rmnet0). We learn that rmnet1 belongs to VoLTE
because it appears/disappears when VoLTE is enabled/disabled. Fig-
ures 4 (left) and 5 (left) show the snapshots at two mobile phones
in OP-I, captured by Network Info II, an Android app [3]. In both
operators, IPv6 is used. IP addresses for both interfaces are differ-
ent. Note that the roles of rmnet0 and rmnet1 may be swapped.
We can infer them based on the routing table. The one assigned to
the default routing rule is for the PS data service, and the other is
for VoLTE. Second, we validate that the unprivileged applications
are able to inject non-VoLTE trafﬁc into the signaling bearer via
the VoLTE interface. The test works as follows. We send a UDP
packet with Hop Limit being set to 1, to the VoLTE signaling server
and then receive an ICMP packet from the VoLTE gateway via the
VoLTE interface. It is from the gateway because this IP address
differs from that serving PS data services. This implies that this
UDP packet is indeed sent through the signaling bearer, out of the
phone.
Causes and lessons. We further examine why neither software
nor hardware at the phone provides proper access control for the
VoLTE signaling bearer. In general, the OS employs permission
control or uses execution container to protect network access (e.g.,
WiFi). However, it does not invoke system permission control
for VoLTE. This is possibly because no corresponding mechanism
in the OS distinguishes the network interface dedicated to VoLTE
from that for the Internet data access. From the OS standpoint,
accessing to both interfaces is identical, without any extra require-
ment from the underlying chipset. On the hardware side, the current
practice fully relies on the software protection, and always trusts
the trafﬁc coming from the software’s VoLTE interface. Concerted
effort in both software and hardware to protect the VoLTE access is
missing, when the chipset opens up the access to the OS.

V2: Imprudent Routing and Forwarding in the Network

The next weakness lies on the network side in its routing and
packet forwarding. It leads to two unexpected consequences. First,
trafﬁc carried through the VoLTE signaling bearer is not veriﬁed at
runtime. Non-authentic control packets can be forwarded by the
network. Without runtime ﬁltering, the packets not destined to the

(b) Mobile-to-Mobile (M1 → M2)

the VoLTE signaling interface (rmnet1) of Mobile 1 to Mo-
bile 2. Both VoLTE-to-VoLTE (rmnet1) and VoLTE-to-DATA
(rmnet0) are supported.

VoLTE servers in the IMS core, can sneak in through the VoLTE
bearer.

Second, routing rules within mobile networks are prone to abuse.
VoLTE phones need to exchange signaling messages with each other
via the VoLTE signaling server. When the routing rule toward each
phone exists for the signaling bearer at the 4G gateway, phones can
communicate with each other without reaching the signaling server.
It thus enables direct, Mobile-to-Mobile communication. Mean-
while, it also opens the door to non-VoLTE Mobile-to-Mobile data
communication. It is likely that routing rules to the rest of the Inter-
net exist; this facilitates the Mobile-to-Internet data access through
the VoLTE signaling bearer.
Empirical validation.
used to perform both (i) Mobile-to-Internet and (ii) Mobile-to-Mobile
data service (Figure 2c). The former is only feasible in OP-I, whereas
the latter works for both.

The VoLTE signaling bearer can be mis-

(i) Mobile-to-Internet: We observe message exchange between
the phone and an external server through the VoLTE interface. We
ﬁrst uses rmnet1 to ping a Google public DNS server (its ad-
dress is 2001:4860:4860::8888). Figure 4b shows partial
packet traces collected via a tcpdump-like trafﬁc sniffer, Shark [4].
The ﬁrst two SIP messages indicate that the rmnet1 interface is
indeed used for VoLTE signaling. The following ping request and
reply exchanged between the phone and the Google DNS server
reveal that, it is viable to exploit the VoLTE signaling bearer to de-
liver normal data trafﬁc. Both inbound (downlink) and outbound
(uplink) data transfers are feasible. We also deploy an IPv6 server
outside the mobile network and repeat the test, and similar results
are observed.

(ii) Mobile-to-Mobile: We ﬁnd that VoLTE can be exploited to
directly communicate with another mobile device belonging to the
same carrier. We send ICMP Echo Requests from the VoLTE inter-
face of one phone (Mobile 1) to another phone (Mobile 2) via its
VoLTE and data-service interfaces (see both interfaces in the left
plot of Figure 5). The right plot shows Mobile 1 receives ICMP
Echo Reply packets in both VoLTE-to-VoLTE and VoLTE-to-Data

cases in OP-I. This conﬁrms that both forms of Mobile-to-Mobile
communication are feasible in OP-I. We ﬁnd that OP-II supports
only the VoLTE-to-VoLTE option for Mobile-to-Mobile communi-
cation, but permits only UDP trafﬁc instead of ICMP. This implies
that more defenses are implemented in the core network of OP-II,
but they are still insufﬁcient to guard against the VoLTE exploit.

We also examine the feasibility of protocol variants. Both UDP
and ICMP work for OP-I, whereas only UDP is allowed for OP-
II. The slight difference is that some, but not all UDP ports work
in OP-I whereas almost all the ports can work in OP-II. In OP-I,
the viable UDP port varies in the tests and requires pre-scanning.
This divergence reﬂects the operator’s freedom in making their own
policy and implementation. However, TCP is not allowed for both
carriers in any case. Later, we will demonstrate that the attack is
always viable as long as at least one protocol is allowed to traverse
the core network over VoLTE signaling. Any real trafﬁc (TCP or
UDP) can be encapsulated in ICMP/UDP tunneling.
Causes and lessons.
The operator does not properly regulate
routing and packet forwarding for the VoLTE signaling bearer. On
the network side, the carrier does not enforce access protection for
VoLTE, similar to CS voice calls and normal PS data. Once this
bearer is allocated for the VoLTE control plane, the network re-
lies on the phone to forward authentic signaling messages (unfor-
tunately, it is not guaranteed). This imprudent practice ignores the
distinction of VoLTE from CS calls and normal PS data (see V3
and V4 exploits later). Packets carried by the signaling bearer from
the phone, should only reach the VoLTE signaling server, but not
another phone or an Internet host, and vice versa.
3.2 Exploiting VoLTE for Free Data Access

Taking charging into account makes the unintended data access
more threatening. The practice is that data/voice billing has never
taken VoLTE signaling messages into account (V3). If the trafﬁc
is delivered through the signaling bearer, it is free of charge. This
remains valid regardless of whether the trafﬁc is destined to the
signaling server or not.

V3: Abusing No Billing of VoLTE Signaling

VoLTE control signals are free of charge. Any packets via VoLTE
signaling bearer are free, no matter whether their destination is
the VoLTE signaling server or not. Therefore, such unintended
data transfer is treated as VoLTE signaling and bypasses the billing
mechanism for normal PS data access. Typically, mobile data ac-
cess is charged based on volume (i.e., the number of delivered
bytes).

It is not surprising for operators to make VoLTE signaling deliv-
ery exempted from charging. Since VoLTE continues to offer call
service, it is natural to adopt the time-based charging, following the
common practice for traditional CS voice. Consequently, only the
call duration on the data plane is collected for billing. VoLTE con-
trol messages are used to facilitate voice calls and should be free of
charge. Moreover, some signals are even exchanged before the call
is established, for example, SIP-INVITE, SIP-INVITE-OK,
SIP-INVITE-ACK messages are used to set up a call. However,
the practice to supply free VoLTE signaling does have loopholes.
The operators does not enforce that all packets going through the
VoLTE signaling bearer are indeed control messages. Even worse,
there is no effective mechanism to limit the trafﬁc volume going
through it. As a result, this can be readily abused to make “free”
data service.
Empirical validation. We ﬁrst show that genuine signaling mes-
sages (through rmnet1) are free of charge. We generate excessive

such messages by attempting to make many calls; every 15 sec-
onds, we dial and immediately hang up before the call is answered.
This lasts for 10 hours. We deliver 42.4 MB control messages in
total, but none is charged in the data bill. Moreover, no minutes are
charged since no call is made through.

We further examine fake signals bypassing the server are still
free. We test it with the VoLTE-to-VoLTE internal case in Figure 5.
In an experimental run, we send 5000 ICMP Echo Requests (each
carrying 1 KB) and receive 4914 ICMP Echo Replies; The trafﬁc is
about 10 MB (both uplink and downlink), but neither volume-based
nor time-based billing is incurred. Similar results are observed in
other test runs.
Causes and lessons.
There is nothing wrong to practice the
policy of free VoLTE signaling. However, people do have incen-
tives to exploit any transfer that is free. This requires either bullet-
proof access control or no free-of-charge policy, or both. Com-
pared with another free data access via DNS tunneling disclosed
in [23], VoLTE signaling faces more challenges. It aims to continue
the traditional business model and VoLTE accounting only logs the
time duration for the data-plane voice. The 4G gateway executes
volume-based accounting for data access, but does not record the
usage volume for the VoLTE signaling bearer.
3.3 Manipulating Data Access Priority

Unsurprisingly, the VoLTE-exploited data access can obtain higher,

yet underserved priority. The high priority is assigned to provide
QoS for VoLTE. However, the expedited delivery at high priority
hurts normal PS data services, particularly during network conges-
tion.

V4: Abusing high QoS of VoLTE Signaling

A prominent feature of VoLTE is its capability to guarantee high
quality for voice calls. Table 2 lists relevant bearer conﬁgurations
speciﬁed in the 3GPP standard [7]. Each bearer is associated with
a QoS class of identiﬁer (QCI), which deﬁnes the IP packet char-
acteristics in terms of priority level, bandwidth guarantee, packet
delay and loss. The VoLTE signaling bearer has highest priority
level (i.e., 1) whereas the data bearer (e.g., web, video streaming)
has the lowest one (i.e., 9). VoLTE-exploited data access can fur-
ther suppress normal PS data with preemptive privileges. Note that
both belong to the non-guaranteed bit rate category, whereas the
voice bearer with QCI = 1 has guaranteed bit rate (GBR). GBR
states that the bearer is granted dedicated network resources over
both radio and wired links and assured voice quality by ensuring
the average rate given a period of time. This will be exploited later
in §4.1.
Empirical validation. We validate it through two compara-
tive experiments: (1) During a long-lived downlink data session
(10Mbps), we launch another VoLTE-exploited data access. The
source rate is larger than the affordable downlink throughput (30 Mbps)
and lasts between the 15th second to 45th (Figure 6a); (2) We
swap the launch ordering for normal data session and the VoLTE-
exploited one (Figure 6b). It is seen that the VoLTE-exploited data

access has higher priority, thus suppressing the normal one with
preemptive privileges. The data bearer throughput rapidly shrinks
to zero when the downlink resource is captured by the signaling
bearer. On the contrary, the data session cannot affect the through-
put of the signaling bearer. It can only grab the remaining resource
and its peak throughput is throttled.
Causes and lessons.
Similar to V3, nothing seems to be wrong
for the operator to offer higher QoS to VoLTE. However, without
prudent trafﬁc ﬁltering, it likely becomes an incentive for the ad-
versary to exploit VoLTE.
3.4 Proof-of-concept Attacks

We devise three proof-of-concept attacks: (1) free data service;
(2) data DoS; (3) data overcharging. They are illustrated in the top,
middle, and bottom of Figure 7, respectively. The ﬁrst one works
for both operators, whereas the last two are feasible for only OP-I.
All are easily launched and also damaging. Note that the last two
attacks do not require root privilege at the victims.
Free-data attack. Clearly, the above loopholes can be exploited
to gain free external (Mobile-to-Internet) and internal (Mobile-to-
Mobile) data access. Note that the free external service works for
only OP-I, but the free internal service is feasible for both. Take
the OP-I as an example. The attacks work as follows. The adver-
sary leverages ICMP tunneling to deliver data through the signal-
ing bearer, since the ICMP packets are always allowed to be for-
warded by the 4G gateway to the Internet or another mobile phone.
Each data packet is encapsulated as an ICMP packet by using Raw
Socket. Moreover, the routing table needs to be updated with the
routing rules of designated destinations, so the ICMP packet can be
sent via the signaling bearer to the destinations. These two opera-
tions can only be performed on a rooted phone. In the external case,
we deploy a tunneling server out of mobile networks to run ICMP
tunneling. In the internal case, the ICMP tunneling is between two
VoLTE phones.

We test with various trafﬁc source rates (up to 16 Mbps) and
execution time (up to 10 hours) for both cases. Figure 8 shows that

no sign of limit exhibits on the volume, throughput, and duration
for free data service in the external and internal cases, respectively.
In a test run, 450MB is observed free of charge.
Data DoS Attack.
This attack aims to shut down any ongo-
ing data service at the victim by leveraging higher-priority access
yielded by VoLTE-exploited data transfer. The attacker injects high-
rate spamming trafﬁc through its signaling bearer, to the victim
phone’s signaling bearer. It can grab all the downlink bandwidth
of the victim’s data service, thereby causing data DoS. Note that
the attacker and the victim are not charged on this spamming traf-
ﬁc, which is carried by the signaling bearers.

This requires an unprivileged malware on the victim device, which
detects whether any data service starts, similar to the off-path TCP
hijack attack [27, 28]. Once the victim starts any data service, this
malware will send a message to an attacker server or an attack
phone, leaking the IP address of the VoLTE interface. Afterwards,
the attacker starts to inject high-rate spamming data to this IP. In the
cases of rush-hour trafﬁc (e.g., 11am-1pm at a campus restaurant),
it is observed that the data bearer throughput can be restrained to be
zero, under a 10Mbps VoLTE-exploited ﬂow. Note that the required
volume of the VoLTE-exploited ﬂow for data DoS varies with the
trafﬁc load of the network where the victim is.
Overcharging Attack.
The attacker can make the victim suf-
fer excessive overcharge through injecting data from its signaling
bearer into the victim phone’s data-service bearer. There is only
one difference from the above DoS attack. The DoS attack spams
data toward the victim phone’s signaling bearer. The chosen victim

is an individual phone user, targeted or randomly picked. Given the
victim’s IP address, we uncover this data spamming can occur with-
out consent from the victim. The IP address can be learned from
a phishing Website or an unprivileged malware. Compared with
other spamming attacks [18,23,24], this threat readily bypasses the
ﬁrewall and security boxes. This is because they are always de-
ployed at the border of mobile networks to prevent malicious traf-
ﬁc from the Internet. However, the spamming caused by VoLTE
purely relies on the internal trafﬁc without reaching the Internet.
In one run in OP-I, the overcharged volume reached 449 MB, still
showing no sign of limit.

3.5 Attacks on Real Apps

We further apply two attacks of free Mobile-to-Internet data ser-
vice and data DoS to real apps. With the former, we use the Skype
service with ICMP tunneling over mobile network for free-of-charge.
The latter force both the Web browser and Youtube to abort at the
victim’s phone. Note that these two attacks are feasible only for
OP-I.
Free Skype service over mobile network We build an ICMP
tunnel between the phone and our external server, in order to ex-
ploit the free VoLTE-exploited data service. As shown in Figure 9,
we deploy a tunneling server outside the mobile network. It sits be-
tween the phone, and application servers or other communicating
hosts. At the phone, we create a virtual interface and modify the
routing table to achieve two purposes. First, it is set to be the de-
fault interface for apps so that all the apps’ packets are forwarded
to it. Second, all the packets from the interface are redirected to
our tunneling server. The server does encapsulation/decapsulation
and the packets relay for the phone. Thus, the application servers
or other communicating hosts do not require to be modiﬁed.

We then run the Skype app on top of it. We show that a malicious
user with ICMP tunneling over the mobile network can have a 10-
minute chat with another Skype user. Moreover, the data volume
consumed during this time period is free-of-charge. Note that other
apps can also be free-of-charge over mobile network by taking ad-
vantage of ICMP tunneling.

bit rate for its QoS conﬁguration), thereby being exposed to mali-
cious exploits (V6).

dition of rush-hour trafﬁc. It is observed that both CNN browsing
and Youtube watching are forced to abort, as shown in Figures 10a
and 10b.

4. MUTING VOICE THROUGH SPAMS IN

VOLTE DATA PLANE

We further investigate insecurity on the VoLTE data plane, as
well as the coordination between it and the control plane. We dis-
cover that the data plane is not well protected, regardless of cer-
tain mechanisms to protect the conﬁdential voice session informa-
tion, compared with those on the control plane. Unprivileged apps,
which do not require rooting or jailbreaking the phone, can inject
non-voice junk into voice bearers. Moreover, the private informa-
tion can be leaked from both the designated scheme for voice QoS
and the coordination lapse. By exploiting them, we devise a novel
voice DoS attack where a VoLTE call can be made through, but
its voice is muted (i.e., the caller and the callee cannot hear each
other).
4.1

Injecting Packets into the Voice Bearer

In the data-plane operation, a voice bearer is built on-demand
upon any call request, and then released after the call ends. Given
the PS nature, it is also vulnerable to the injection of non-voice
packets. However, compared with the signaling bearer, the voice
bearer appears safer with two inherent protection mechanisms. First,
voice packets are handled by the hardware (chipset) without soft-
ware intervention. As shown in Figure 3, their payload must be
encoded or decoded by the IMS (VoLTE) stack in the chipset (e.g.,
Qualcomm Snapdragon Processors), without reaching mobile OS.
Therefore, without hardware hack, it is unlikely for any app above
the mobile OS to deliver valid data through the voice bearer. Sec-
ond, each RTP session identiﬁer (i.e., the destination IP and a pair
of ports for RTP and RTCP) is protected as a secret, not being ex-
posed to the OS. This information is encrypted in the signaling
messages and varies with each call.
It is difﬁcult for the adver-
sary to get the session ID and forge the packet header (with correct
session ID).

However, after thorough analysis, we ﬁnd that the current de-
fenses are still insufﬁcient to protect the data plane. It is vulnerable
to deliver invalid packets (junk data) through the voice bearer. We
unveil two vulnerabilities in the data plane. First, the VoLTE data-
plane access control is problematic (V5) so that it is possible to in-
ject data to the voice bearer, though the delivered bytes are beyond
control by apps. Second, the conﬁdential VoLTE data-plane session

The data plane is also without sufﬁcient access control. Com-
pared with the control plane, it generates all voice packets within
the hardware. Speciﬁcally, the voice codec that converts an ana-
log voice signal to digitally encoded bytes, is implemented within
the chipset, as illustrated in Figure 3. However, the seemingly se-
cure hardware protection mechanism is still not sufﬁcient. It never
restricts the access to authentic VoLTE calls only (i.e., the system-
level dialer app). Instead, it accepts trafﬁc injected by other apps,
even those unprivileged ones, if they get the correct session infor-
mation. One thing worth noting is that the hardware buffer for the
voice bearer may overﬂow if the injected trafﬁc exceeds the max-
imum bit rate (MBR) (e.g., tens of kbps), which caps the voice
bearer trafﬁc. Genuine voice packets might be consequently dis-
carded, thus degrading the voice quality.
Empirical validation. We conﬁrm that an app without root priv-
ilege can inject high-rate trafﬁc into the voice bearer. We run this
application during an ongoing call at the callee, and generates pack-
ets with the voice RTP session identiﬁer (i.e., destination IP and
RTP/RTCP ports) of the ongoing call at 10 Mbps rate, and sends
them via the VoLTE interface. We will disclose how we exact the
voice RTP session identiﬁer in V6 and V7. We run 20 tests and
consistently observe that the callee’s voice is muted at the caller
(i.e., no voice from the callee). This implies that the data packets
created by the unprivileged app has been successfully injected into
the voice bearer and the injected trafﬁc indeed overﬂows the uplink
buffer of the voice bearer at the callee, with most voice packets
being discarded.
Causes and lessons.
without authenticating the origin of voice trafﬁc. The ﬁrst guard
comes from the VoLTE common operation that the data plan fol-
lows the legacy design (i.e., CS voice). Voice trafﬁc is encoded/decoded
by speciﬁc codec in the hardware, so it does not require software
intervention. It inherently prevents the non-VoLTE apps from abus-
ing the voice bearer. However, it merely reduces the hijacking like-
lihood but cannot avoid hijacking. The second defense relies on
the secrecy of RTP session ID. Neither checks whether the traf-
ﬁc comes from the real VoLTE application. The hardware allows
for the voice transfer from the OS, which still permits trafﬁc from
non-VoLTE apps.

The current two defenses are still ill-equipped,

V6: Side-channel Leakage of Session Privacy

The ID of each RTP session is regarded as a session secret [26].
It is carried by the signaling messages of the VoLTE application,
and may be further encrypted. Without root privilege, other un-
privileged apps should not be able to capture the signaling, thereby
learning the session ID. Figure 11 shows an example of the session
ID in a SIP message. Note that we get it by decrypting the en-
crypted SIP message from OP-I according to the method [2]. Note
that the decryption requires root privilege.

We however propose an approach to obtain the ID through side-
channel hints without root privilege or call operation permission. It
contains two parts. First, the destination IP address (i.e., the media
gateway’s IP) can be easily retrieved from the routing table. Sec-
ond, the RTP and RTCP port numbers can be inferred from a unique
pattern due to its guaranteed-bit-rate QoS scheme. Speciﬁcally, the
standard regulates that the voice bearer should be guaranteed with

a minimum rate (e.g., 8 KB/s) [10], regardless of whether packets
over the highest-priority signaling bearer would be served.

Moreover, the VoLTE signaling and voice bearers use the same
IP allocated to the VoLTE interface, and the packets for these two
bearers are differentiated based on their corresponding ports. That
is, only the packets with the RTP and RTCP ports of the session
ID are delivered to the voice bearer, whereas the others are to the
signaling bearer. Hence, it is possible to learn the session ports
by scanning all ports (sending one packet via one port). In case
of injecting heavy trafﬁc into the signaling bearer, the ones over
the voice bearer would have much smaller delay, since they have
guaranteed resource. In fact, the two ports with the smallest delay
should be the ones used by RTP and RTCP.
Empirical validation. We focus only on the destination ports
of the uplink RTP session (i.e., RTP and RTCP ports), since the
destination IP can be obtained as disclosed in §3.1.

During an ongoing call, the application without root privilege
does two things. First, it scans each port by sending one packet.
Second, it keeps sending many packets to certain ports (e.g., 80)
which are deﬁnitely not for RTP and RTCP, in order to overwhelm
the signaling bearer. We consider one-hop RTT for each port, where
we sent a UDP packet with Hop Limit being set to 1, and receive
ICMP response. The one-hop RTT is calculated based on the time
difference between the sending time of the UDP packet and the
receipt time of the ICMP response. Figure 12a plots the perceived
delay in one test run. The packets with two destination ports, 64580
and 64581, have the smallest delay, 39 ms, whereas other ports ex-
perience larger delay (> 90ms). These ports match those disclosed
from the decrypted SIP messages. Figure 12b shows that the delay
gap between the RTP/RTCP ports and other ports is consistently
observed, with at least as large as 50 ms in the 20 tests. So it is
viable to infer the RTP port numbers, though they vary in each run.
Causes and Lessons.
Two factors may trespass session privacy.
First, signaling and voice packets are dispatched from the VoLTE
interface based on an exclusive rule in that, those with the voice
session ID are delivered to the voice bearer, and others to the sig-
naling bearer. Second, resource reservation for the voice bearer is
not affected by the signaling bearer. This side information helps to
differentiate the two bearers. Therefore, QoS is good for perfor-
mance but can be bad for privacy.
4.2 Leakage in Coordination between Planes
We further disclose another weakness in the coordination be-
tween control and data planes. This makes it easier to leak the
voice session ID.

V7: Side-channel Leakage by Improper Coordination

The session ID can also be leaked from improper coordination
between planes. It can be obtained during call setup and call termi-
nation. At these two phases, the voice bearer on the data plane is

established and released upon receiving certain signals on the con-
trol plane. When operations are not invoked in the correct timing
sequence, voice packets can be erroneously delivered to the control
plane.

We ﬁrst see that some initial voice packets from the media gate-
way will be forwarded to the control plane when the voice bearer
is not established in time. This is because the 4G gateway has only
one forwarding rule for the VoLTE IP (i.e., to/from the signaling
bearer) before the voice bearer is created. For example, certain
initial voice packets, such as alerting tone and early media (e.g.,
CallerTune), should be delivered to the phone before the call is
answered. The media gateway in the IMS core does have valid rea-
sons to do so. This is a voice feature provided by most operators.

We further observe a few VoLTE voice packets from the control-
plane interface after the call hangs up. It turns out that, the sig-
naling server consists of two separate components, i.e., the proxy
server and the serving server. The former regulates the establish-
ment/release of voice bearer at the 4G gateway, whereas the lat-
ter manages the start/stop of voice delivery at the media gateway.
However, there is no explicit coordination procedure between them.
Instead, implicit coordination is activated through the signaling mes-
sages passing them. When the phone terminates a call, it sends a
SIP BYE message. This message ﬁrst arrives at the proxy server,
and is then forwarded to the serving server. Through this sequence,
the former releases the voice bearer before the latter stops deliv-
ering voice packets. As a result, voice packets arriving at the 4G
gateway must be forwarded to the VoLTE signaling bearer, since
there is no voice bearer. When voice packets are forwarded to the
signaling bearer, they reach the phone’s VoLTE interface. Once
captured by non-VoLTE apps, they can leak the session ID.

from the VoLTE signaling interface on the mobile device via Shark [4].
Some VoLTE voice packets (here, UDP) are captured while the user
dials out or hangs up. We further develop an unprivileged app to
capture these early packets. The app binds to the VoLTE IP address
and the UDP source port used by the voice RTP session. The UDP
source port can be inferred; both operators have a simple selection
rule. For OP-I, it starts from the number, 1234, after booting, and
then monotonically increases by 10 for each call. For OP-II, the

port is always 49158. We launch this app before making a VoLTE
call. During the call setup and termination phases, it is observed to
receive some UDP packets. We verify that they indeed belong to
the ongoing call’s RTP session.
Causes and lessons.
VoLTE requires substantial upgrades by
adopting IMS in the mobile network. It incurs complex operations,
which can be exploited for unintended purposes.
4.3 Voice-Muted DoS Attack

We launch an attack to compel the call to be mute, rather than
canceling the call service. Under this attack, the victim can al-
ways establish the call, but neither side can hear each other after
the call is answered. This requires a malware without root privi-
lege or voice call permission in the victim phone. Note that this
malware can be embedded into network applications.

There are two major steps to launch this attack during an ongoing
call. The ﬁrst step is to learn the ports of the RTP session as soon as
possible. We exploit V6 and/or V7 to do that. Exploiting V6 needs
to scan many ports. However, without root privilege, the network
socket returns only the error type of the ICMP messages instead of
their content. So we cannot retrieve the scanned port corresponding
to each received ICMP message within a socket. For this reason,
we do a group-based search. We aggregate ports into many small
groups and compare their smallest delay in each group. We then
scan each port in the group with the smallest delay to locate RTP
ports. It can be done within 20 seconds in our test phones. V7 can
easily aggravate the damage of the voice-muted attack by offering
a faster approach to probing session privacy. The session ID is
directly learned from the initial voice packets, without spending
time on searching for the session ID.

At the second step, the malware starts to hijack the voice bearer
by injecting forged RTP packets with the correct session ID. They
can mute both uplink and downlink voice, even though they are
for only the uplink trafﬁc. This is because the uplink trafﬁc of
RTP packets overloads one hardware component, Robust Header
Compression (RoHC), which is required by VoLTE for voice packet
(de)compression [5]. Figure 14 shows one run of the aggregated
voice-muted attack when V7 is exploited. The malware starts to
launch the DoS attack at the 8th second, after the call is answered,
and stops at 31th second. During the attack period, the voice at
both the caller and the callee become silent for most of the time.
Once the ID is leaked, this attack remains effective until the call
ends. The attack works no matter whether the malware is at the
caller or the callee.

5. RECOMMENDED FIX

exert little control over devices and have more incentives to ﬁx
these issues.

First, the 4G gateway enforces strict routing regulation for each
bearer. This is to mandate that the trafﬁc carried by the signal-
ing/voice bearer is relayed by the 4G gateway only between the
phone and the signaling server or the media gateway in the IMS
core.
It eliminates V2. Since the hijacked control-plane access
on the device fails to reach any destination, it becomes less ur-
gent to ﬁx V1. However, without ﬁxing V1, it is still vulnerable
to data DoS attacks since precious radio resource might be wasted
before these packets are dropped by the gateway. This requires
the upgrade of the 4G gateway and can be done by adding ﬁlters
for VoLTE bearers. It may need extra effort when adding all valid
servers into the whitelist.

Second, the operator stops practicing free-signaling policy and
charges signals similar to data trafﬁc. This eliminates V3 and also
largely reduces user incentives to exploit VoLTE for data access.
However, this requires the upgrade of the billing system. The 4G
gateway should also enable its accounting for signaling packets.
The main challenge is not on the technical side but on the business
practice. It requires every user to possess a data plan. Today, voice
plans are independent of data plans.
In LTE networks, it seems
reasonable to let each consumer subscribe to a data plan for the
Internet access. A supplementary solution is to enable a VoLTE
data volume quota for each voice plan. When the volume is be-
low this quota, it incurs no extra charge. This quota is based on
the common usage case when the signaling volume for each call is
typically small. This approach does not require users to be aware
of the billing changes in benign scenarios, but abusing VoLTE for a
large amount of volume delivery can be identiﬁed and charged for
the extra.

Third, regarding DoS attacks, it calls for new mechanism to en-
sure resource allocation to authentic trafﬁc only. A naive solution
is to abandon high-priority QoS for VoLTE. However, it essentially
ruins the VoLTE’s appealing features. An alternative remedy is to
enforce the deferral mechanism. Once the trafﬁc is detected as fake
or junk trafﬁc, the volume will be accounted, and the source will
be traced back if the volume exceeds certain threshold. At runtime,
whenever the requested resource is larger than the quota, its priority
is decreased. This scheme relieves, but does not eliminate preemp-
tive resource waste. Ideally, the safeguard should be implemented
at the device to prevent non-authentic trafﬁc from being sent out.
However, this may raise a new form of exploit of blocked access by
leveraging the deferral mechanism if a malware is deployed at the
victim.

On the device side, we suggest two remedies. First, the mobile
OS should build a VoLTE permission that only allows the dialer
app to access the VoLTE interface. Malware should not easily ob-
tain private information. However, for a rooted phone, this pro-
tection might be bypassed. Second, the chipset enforces stringent
access control. For the trafﬁc from the OS, it needs to verify the
trafﬁc source and destination, as well as session port numbers, if

325applicable. This resolves issues in most common settings, but can-
not eliminate voice-muted attacks when a privileged malware on a
rooted phone is in place. This latter case calls for defenses against
mobile malware, which are complementary to above fences. Note
that the device-based solutions really help but do not sufﬁce. In
some cases of legacy or compromised devices, the network-based
solutions are still required.

Note that, the fundamental issues lie in the PS service and can-
not be completely addressed by above ﬁxes. The long-term so-
lution calls for concerted effort to design security defenses for the
given form of PS service with voice-speciﬁc policies (e.g., resource
consumption and billing). Our near-term solution aims to permit
VoLTE for authentic voice only. This is to ensure backward com-
patibility with current practice. As more services are empowered
by VoLTE (e.g., HD video conferencing), it might not be the best
choice any more. However, the rule is still applicable: When it
works as PS data, it should be treated as PS data. Keeping a clean
and consistent policy helps to eradicate unnecessary exploits.

6. DISCUSSION

We next clarify several remaining issues.

Bugs in early deployment?
Hard-core optimists might claim
that the revealed problems are implementation bugs at the early
stage of deployment. They are likely to get ﬁxed quickly as the
deployment proceeds. Indeed, it turns out that the vulnerabilities
we demonstrate are not hard to address. However, most of them
are rooted in the VoLTE technology itself, but not carriers’ speciﬁc
misconﬁguration. For example, both free-data and voice-muted at-
tacks are feasible in both carriers. They are not simple bugs either,
because where the vulnerability occurs is not equivalent to where
the negative impact occurs: the device-side vulnerability (e.g. V1)
results in network-side revenue loss, while the network-side vulner-
ability (e.g. V2 and V7) makes mobile device suffering from over-
charging and voice mute attacks. Uncovering these vulnerabilities
require a cooperative understanding of both the mobile device and
the network. Because of this, it is not surprising that top carriers
largely ignore them so far, and leave their deployed networks open
to these attacks. Our ongoing interactions with such carriers indi-
cate that, some of them are unaware of such loopholes even though
some are implementation and operation glitches. The deeper rea-
son is that, VoLTE has revolutionized the legacy voice service in
mobile carriers, and complete understanding of its impact on the
4G system security is still missing. Since the US carriers act as
leaders in the global market, the lessons from their early deploy-
ment are critical to the booming of secure VoLTE technology in the
future.
Symptoms of incomplete transition?
These problems can also
be attributed to the incomplete transition from the old-fashioned
mentality of mobile network to the Internet-style thinking. The for-
mer has been used to have control over all mobile devices since the
early CS-based network. In contrast, the latter considers no control
of devices, each of which can be potentially malicious. Since the
mobile network adopts the Internet technologies (e.g., IP), it has
been giving more freedom to mobile devices and gradually having
less control over them. However, its fundamental designs and op-
erations are not developed by completely following the Internet’s
way of thinking. This way can cause the mobile network to lack
protection against malicious mobile devices.
Blaming operators? While LTE operators and users suffer from
these attacks, our position should be misinterpreted as a directed
blame on network carriers (neither users). In fact, all parties con-

tribute to the threats. Reshaping voice from CS to PS warrants
substantial upgrades on all parties, including device OS and app
developers, mobile chipset vendors, network equipment manufac-
turers and operators. The developers and vendors for the device
OS, chipsets and network equipments should all share the respon-
sibility without upgrading their access (permission) control in time.
They together expose loopholes by the two IP interfaces for VoLTE
and normal data. Without a holistic view how VoLTE works, each
party takes a myopic approach to potential threats.
Incentives.
Our focus so far is on vulnerabilities, but not on
attack incentives. For certain attacks (e.g., free data access), people
are always motivated to leverage the loopholes. For other attacks
(e.g., DoS), it might be for fun or self interests for someone to block
another’s access to voice or data.
7. UPDATE

We are working with the industry to resolve the identiﬁed issues.
We have already informed a major chipset vendor of the potential
risks and are about to contact more vendors (including both OS and
network equipment ones) regarding VoLTE access control vulner-
abilities. We have also contacted both carriers to report and help
to ﬁx such vulnerabilities. So far, all data-relevant attacks, includ-
ing free data attack, overbilling, preemptive data and data DoS at-
tacks, have been ﬁxed in OP-I carrier networks, since data packets
through the VoLTE interface are not allowed to traverse the core
network. The ﬁx of voice DoS attacks, as well as the problems in
another carrier is ongoing.
8. RELATED WORK

Several studies have explored security implications of the com-
ponent solutions: IMS [22], SIP [31,36] and VoIP [17,19,38]. Park
et al. model the threat and analyze possible issues of the IMS
deployment [22]. Other studies [17, 19, 31, 38] examine SIP and
VoIP in the Internet context, without addressing mobile network is-
sues. They focus on caller ID spooﬁng or SIP message spooﬁng to
launch DoS/DDoS attacks. Recent reports (e.g., [1]) look into the
VoLTE security but are limited to issues (e.g., caller ID spooﬁng)
addressed by previous studies. Our recent work revealed another
voice DoS attack but it is launched through ﬁne-grained manipula-
tion of signaling messages in VoLTE [36]. In addition, most VoLTE
research focuses on its performance analysis or deployment plan-
ning [20,21,37]. Our study differs from all prior arts. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study on VoLTE security over oper-
ational networks. Our work covers both security analysis and real-
world impact, whereas early ﬁndings are obtained by security anal-
ysis or limited experiments in the controlled environment. More
importantly, the vulnerabilities and attacks discussed in this paper,
have never been disclosed before.

Mobile network security has been an active research area in re-
cent years. Peng et al. and Go et al.
identify the loopholes in
mobile data charging and devise free data access and overcharging
attacks [18, 23–25, 35]. Enck and Traynor and et al. devise DoS
attacks by overloading the control channel for SMS and other ser-
vices [15,32,33]. Researchers also disclose vulnerabilities in other
cellular-speciﬁc components, such as user authentication loopholes [11,
12], MMS spamming [29], information leakage at ﬁrewalls [27,28],
and WiFi-calling loopholes in T-Mobile [13], to name a few. Our
work is different since we look into VoLTE, an emerging voice ser-
vice to 4G LTE networks. Mobile malware has been another well-
covered topic (see [14, 39] for a few samples). Our DoS attacks
require a malware without root permission, and we leave malware
infection as an independent topic [16, 34].

3269. CONCLUSION

VoLTE is still at its early phase for global rollout. It is natural
to suffer from easy-to-ﬁx mistakes during this period. However,
we seek to sort out the fundamental issues beyond simple bugs and
errors. Bearing the telecom-based design mindset, VoLTE calls for
substantial upgrades on the infrastructure side (complex functions
in the core), and device updates as well. In this work, we examine
the security implications of VoLTE. We show that VoLTE can be
exploited to launch attacks against both the network operator (thus
beneﬁting mobile users) and an individual user. The user may gain
free and high-priority data access by abusing the VoLTE signaling
bearer to carry data packets. (S)he may also suffer from voice/data
DoS attacks due to spamming over the voice/signaling bearer.

Two lessons can be learned from our work. First, VoLTE op-
erates on both control and data planes. Its signaling and data are
implemented in both software and hardware at the device, and car-
ried by distinctive radio bearers within LTE. Consequently, to se-
cure both planes, the solution calls for concerted effort between
the network infrastructure and the end host, as well as the soft-
ware and the hardware at the device. Second, VoLTE leverages the
high priority services (compared with the low-priority, best-effort
delivery) in mobile networks to ensure quality calls. The priority
services supplemented by the LTE network may serve as an im-
plicit side-channel to leak conﬁdential information. As the voice
solution becomes compatible with the Internet design, it is prudent
to add more intelligence at the device and the network, to address
the double-edged, security side-effects of PS and IP.
