  Segregate personal communication and entertainment from 

business and government operations!
  In untrusted environment: Web browser, online gaming, social 

  In trusted environment: Online banking, shopping, business 

web portal!

email!

  Trusted computing environment!

  Separate/isolate the trusted environment from the untrusted 

environment!

Red/Green system: Policy + Isolation + Accountability +Freedom!

* Butler Lampson, Accountability and Freedom Slides, Microsoft, September 2005!

  Our work focuses on isolation between two environments!

  Not on how the users decide what applications go into each OS !
  Not  on how to give the user control over data exchanges between the two 

environments!

Our work provides an BIOS-assistant OS level isolation!

•    without using any mutable software layer (e.g., hypervisor)!
•    no changes of the OS source code !
•    no data leak between two OS environments!
•    fast switching time, around 6 seconds!

ACPI Sleeping States!
  Advanced Conﬁguration and Power Interface (ACPI)!

  OS-directed conﬁguration; Power/thermal management!
  Industrial standard widely supported !

  Global System States!

  G0 --- Working (System Operational) 
  G1---Sleeping (CPU stopped) 
  G2 ---Soft Off 
  G3 ---Mechanical off (Physical off switch) 

  Sleeping States in G1: S1 – S4!

  S3: also called Standby, Suspend to RAM 

  DRAM still maintained 

  S4: also called Hibernation or Suspend to Disk 

  DRAM not maintained 

  Device Power States: D0 – D3!

  D0 - Fully-On!
  D3 --  Power off to device 

BIOS, UEFI, and Coreboot!
  Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)!

  Initializing hardware like processor, memory, chipset, hard disk, 

and other I/O devices.!

  Stored in non-volatile ROM chips.!

  Uniﬁed Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)!

  Deﬁne a new software interface between OS and ﬁrmware.!
  Ease the development by switching into protected mode in early 

stage and writing code in C language.!

  Partially open source!

  Coreboot (formerly as LinuxBIOS)!

  Similar functionality as UEFI!
  Open source!
  We use Coreboot V4!

DIMM Mask and DQS Setting!

  A motherboard may have more than one Dual In-line 

Memory Module (DIMM) slot.!
  We assign one DIMM to one OS. !

  BIOS uses “DIMM_MASK” variable to control which 

DIMMs to be enabled.!
  BIOS sets corresponding “data strobes”(DQS) parameters to 

enable DDR RAM memory access.!

  Require two sets of DQS setting to support the two DIMMs used 

by two OSes separately. !

Attack Model!

  Assumption!

  BIOS and option ROM on devices can be trusted.!
  No physical access to the protected machine!

  Attacks from the untrusted OS!

  Data exﬁltration attacks: stealing sensitive data from the trusted 

OS!

  Spooﬁng Trusted OS attacks: deceiving the user into a fake trusted 

OS to perform sensitive transactions.!

  Cache-based side channel attacks: extracting sensitive information!

  Out of the scope !

  Denial of Service attacks!
  Network attacks on trusted OS!
  Malicious device ﬁrmware!

Secure Switching State Machine!

Trusted Path!
  A trusted path assures users that they really are working 

with the operation system they intend to use.!

  Prevent spooﬁng trusted OS attacks!
  Untrusted OS should be truly suspended.!

  OS Flag: which OS should be woken next!
  Boot Flag: if untrusted OS has been loaded!
 Where to save these ﬂags?!
Boot Flag: in CMOS                     !
OS Flag: physical jumper (e.g., pins in Parallel port connector) !

  Power LED lights up when system is powered on, and blinks in the 

sleep mode.!

  BIOS should be entered.!
  Press the power button.!

  Protecting system ﬂags/variables!

Secure Switching Process!

System Isolation!

  CPU Isolation: two OSes never run concurrently. !
  Memory Isolation: physical-level isolation!
  Hard disk isolation: encrypted hard disk + RAM disk!
  Other I/O isolation: clean the buffers and states in devices.!

  Isolation Mechanisms:!

Physical-level Memory Isolation!

  OS environments run in separate Dual In-line Memory 

Modules (DIMMs).!

  BIOS only enables and reports one DIMM for each OS.!

  Two DQS settings for two OSes!
  “DIMM_MASK” controlled by the physical jumper.!
  When the “DIMM_MASK” conﬂicts with DQS setting, the 

system crashes!

  Only the BIOS can initialize and enable the DIMMs; 
software cannot initialize or enable DIMMs after the 
system boots up!

Hard Drive Isolation!

  Hard disk encryption!

  Two hard disks, one for each OS.!
  Disk lock in ATA speciﬁcation!

  BIOS only enables one hard disk!

  Attacker may change the setting to enable all hard disks!
  We use SMM-based detection to check that the channel enable 

registers has not been changed!

  RAM disk !

  For browser-based application, save a small amount of 

temporary data in the RAM!
