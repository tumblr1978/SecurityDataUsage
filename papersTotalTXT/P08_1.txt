Previous Work 

•  How do attackers trick users? 
•  What techniques do they use? 
•  How successful are they? 

–  [Dhamija, CHI ‘06]  
–  [Sunshine, SSYM ’09] 
–  [Egelman, CHI’ 08] 
–  [Friedman, CHI ‘02] 
–  ….and many more 

•  Usability of security solutions…

Our Questions 

•  How do users react to current threats? 

–  XSS, session fixation, exploit links,  
   file-sharing scams, malicious trick banners 

•  …evaluate security implications of actions? 

•  …assess the risk?

Experiment 

•  Online test system 

•  44 security-related scenarios in 3 suites 

–  Web attacks 
–  Email attacks 
–  File-sharing attacks

Contributions 

•  164 participants 
•  Largest study on prevalent attacks 

•  Gain insights into ‘Perception’ & ‘Security’ 
•  Understand decision-making cues 
•  Identify attack vectors

Experiment Design 

•  Perception Score 

–  “How dangerous or safe do you think clicking on 

this link is?” 

•  Security Score 

–  “Would you click on this link?” 

•  “Please explain your reasoning.”

Perception & Security 

•  Non-techies have bad perception 
•  …but still avert attacks! 

•  Exposure? 

–  Spam: 95.7% 
–  Email attacks subverted: 97.1% by intuition 
–  Can this be applied to more complex attacks? 

 Web attacks: 48.9%

Misleading Cues 

•  URL length & complexity: 

–  “Too long and complicated” 
–  “Many  funny letters” 
–  “Has a long name and unknown code in it” 

•  www.paypal.hostding.com: 

–  “Easy to read” 
–  “Clear obvious link” 
–  “[Amazon link] was not like this”

Misleading Cues 

•  File size: 

–  Movie.rar cannot be 700MB 
–  700KB movie from 1922: legit 

•  Informed decisions not possible 
 Rely on misleading cues
