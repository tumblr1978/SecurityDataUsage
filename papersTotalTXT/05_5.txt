In this work, we examine how an adversary in control
of a BGP speaker in a transit AS can cause a victim router
in an arbitrary location on the Internet to become unstable.
Through experimentation with both hardware and software
routers, we look at the behavior of routers under abnor-
mal conditions and come to four conclusions. First, routers
placed in certain states behave in anything but a stable man-
ner. Second, unexpected but perfectly legal BGP messages
can place routers into those states with disconcerting ease.
Third, an adversary can use these messages to disrupt a vic-
tim router to which he is not directly connected. Fourth,
modern best practices do little to prevent these attacks.

experi-
ments on hardware
and software routers,
we
observed what
happens when routers
ﬁnd
themselves
starved for CPU cy-
cles or memory. We
witnessed a variety of
failure modes, ranging
from severe perfor-
mance degradation to the unrecoverable failure of all active
routing sessions. We also observed that a router placed into
one of these states would more than likely cause its peers
to enter one or more of these states as well. An example of
this is a CPU starved router was the exhausting its peer’s
memory. When the rate of incoming BGP updates exceeds
a router’s computational capacity, the receiving router only
buffers a ﬁxed number of incoming BGP messages. When
those limits are reached it is up to the sender to buffer
all future updates until the CPU starved router can accept
them. We term this behavior back pressure. Figure 1
opposite shows the increase in memory usage over time for
a router that is attempting to exchange routing tables with a
CPU starved peer versus a peer with sufﬁcient processing
power.

We found it sur-
prisingly easy to force
a router into one of
these unstable states.
the
The majority of
methods we
found
are the result of tak-
ing commonly held
assumptions
about
path
and
invalidating those assumptions. Routers fail to handle these
“corner cases” in a reasonable fashion. For example, in the
software router Quagga uses a small, ﬁxed size hash map
with a predictable hashing function. This is acceptable so
long as the assumption that AS paths will be spread evenly
over all of the buckets holds. However, an adversary can
violate this assumption, advertising AS paths that hash to
the same value. Plots of the time to process updates with
colliding AS paths compared to random AS paths can be
seen in the ﬁgure opposite.

Figure 2.

An adversary in control of a BGP speaker can take ad-
vantage of these assumptions to attack other honest routers.
By convincing legitimate BGP speakers to propagate these
messages, an adversary can push a target in an arbitrary net-
work location into unstable operation. A table below brieﬂy
highlights some current best practices, observations about
how an adversary avoids them, and experimental evidence
to support our observations. Details of how our adversary
launches such an attack, along with how best practice fail to
stop this can be found in our tech report 1.
