Problem definition 

•  Large array of towers broadcasting messages 

–  Can those messages reveal a phone’s location? 

•  Given a person’s phone number 

–  can we locate the tower they are attached to in a GSM 

network? 

•  GSM: dominant protocol worldwide  

–  Analysis of layer 2/3 messages only. 

•  No collaboration from the service provider. 
•  No support from apps.

Bounding the LAC 
•  LACs can be very large. 

–  T-Mobile LAC 747d: 100km2  
•  Used a wall-following algorithm, 

road permitting. 

•  Call to MS on NW corner. 
•  Observed paging request on 

SE corner.

Finding individual towers 
•  Find individual towers with a hill-climbing algorithm. 

–  Non-uniform RF attenuation. 
–  Overshoot by 50m to avoid local maximum.

Start 

–  Less than 0.6% of paging requests are not type 1. 
–  Available bandwidth for additional pages. 
–  Human trajectories are predictable. 

•  Continuous time mixes. 

–  Switch TMSI at least once per page. 

Defenses 
•  Page multiple areas. 

•  phone/TMSI bitwise unlinkable. 

–  Prevent traffic analysis. 

•  Cover traffic. 
•  Add exponential delay to paging requests. 

leak location information. 

•  Leaks observable with  

–  readily available equipment equipment, 
–  no (direct) help from the service provider. 

Conclusion 
•  Systems with broadcast paging protocols could 

•  Proposed low cost fixes. 
•  Responsible disclosures.
