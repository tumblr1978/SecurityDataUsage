Transport Layer Security

• Want to secure traﬃc between web

browsers and servers

• One problem is latency from TLS

Removing round trips

Previous proposal, TLS Snap Start

• Zero round trip handshake

Snap Start challenges

• Client must know server certiﬁcate

• Cached from previous visit

Snap Start challenges

• Client must know server certiﬁcate
• Revocation checking is still slow

• Cached from previous visit

Snap Start challenges

• Client must know server certiﬁcate
• Revocation checking is still slow

• Cached from previous visit

Problem

• TLS imposes extra latency due to

retrieving and validating server
certiﬁcate

• How to obtain certiﬁcate to do Snap

Start handshake?

• How to validate without extra latency?

Contribution

• Real world study of OCSP response

times

• Certiﬁcate prefetching and prevalidation

• Propose four prefetching strategies
• Analysis of eﬀectiveness
• Prototype implementation

How long does OCSP take in the
real world?

• Experimental setup

• OCSP response times collected from

users running Perspectives browser
extensions

• 242 clients, 4474 certiﬁcates, 24

responders

OCSP in the wild

CDF of OCSP response time:

Median: 291 ms, mean: 498 ms

Design

• Prefetch certiﬁcates

• Enables Snap Start handshakes more

frequently

• Prevalidate certiﬁcates

• Removes OCSP lookup from critical path

Design questions

• When to prefetch? When to prevalidate?
• How to obtain certiﬁcate?

When to prefetch

Ideas borrowed from DNS prefetching:

• DNS prefetching triggers are eﬀective

for certs

When to prefetch

Ideas borrowed from DNS prefetching:

• DNS prefetching triggers are eﬀective

for certs

• Could be deployed with HTML hints for

eﬀective prefetching

How to prefetch

• Goal: Obtain server certiﬁcate
• Challenge: Full TLS handshake is

expensive

• Four proposed methods that are more

eﬃcient

Prefetching methods

Option 1: Truncated handshake

Prefetching methods

Option 1: Truncated handshake

• No public key crypto!
• Server admin does nothing
• But implementation requires new API in TLS

layer

Prefetching methods

Option 2: HTTP GET request
e.g., to http://www.domain.com/cert

• Much less load than full TLS handshake, but

still impacts the server

Prefetching methods

What if we want no additional load on
server?

Option 3: Retrieve from CDN

• HTTP GET request, avoid hitting web

server

Option 4: Retrieve from DNS

• DNS TXT record can store certiﬁcate
• No impact on web server

Prevalidation

• After prefetching cert, prevalidate it

• Normal OCSP lookup

Prototype

• Prefetching and prevalidating in

Chromium

• Piggyback on DNS prefetching

architecture

• DNS and HTTP GET prefetching

Analysis

• How much does prefetching and

prevalidating aﬀect handshake latency?

Handshake latency

• Normal TLS handshake: 122 ms
↓ Remove round trips by prefetching cert and using Snap Start

• Snap Start, unvalidated cert: 83 ms

↓ Remove OCSP validation by prevalidating cert

• Snap Start, prevalidated cert: 30 ms

Server: Ubuntu 10.04, 256MB, Apache 2.2.17, Client: Ubuntu 10.04, 1GB RAM

HTTP GET request: 16 ms

Conclusions

• OCSP latency matters, especially when

handshakes have fewer RTTs

• Need prefetched certiﬁcate to enable Snap

Start and for OCSP prevalidation

• 4 proposed strategies for prefetching certs
• Reduce TLS handshake by two RTTs and

OCSP response time (factor of 4 in our
experiments)
