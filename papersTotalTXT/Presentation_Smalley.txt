Building on a Solid Foundation

● Critical role of operating system protection 

mechanisms in supporting higher level security 
goals.
● The Inevitability of Failure:  The Flawed Assumption of Security 

in Modern Computing Environments, 21st NISSC, Oct 1998.

● Flexible Mandatory Access Control (MAC) as a key mechanism

● SE Linux as a well-established foundation for 

mitigating threats posed by flawed and malicious 
applications.

8

SE Android Enhancements
● Kernel Mandatory Access Control (MAC).

● SELinux-based.
● Root exploits are no longer fatal.
● Apps can be strongly separated.

Addressing the Risks

● Requires mechanisms outside the scope of what 

any operating system mechanism can provide.
● Cannot be addressed via SE Android.
● Also true for SE Linux (or any other secure OS).

● Two key enablers emerged in commodity PC 

hardware:
● Virtualization
● Trusted Computing

13

 

Secure Virtual Platform (SVP)
● NSA research program dating back to circa 2002.
● Explored the use of emerging hardware support for 

virtualization and trusted computing to address 
these same kinds of concerns for SE Linux.

● Investigated application of virtualization and trusted 

computing to construct an overall secure system 
architecture.

Virtualization instead

of SE Android?

● Virtualization does not eliminate the need 

for a secure OS.
● Unable to enforce security goals within guest OS.
● Does not address need for controlled sharing.
● Does not protect the data as it is being processed.
● Still need to protect shared services & control plane.
● Limited scalability and flexibility.

Trusted Computing

Security Benefits

✔ Verifiable, trustworthy 
report of loaded software & 
configuration.
✔ Protection of long term 
secrets from leakage or 
misuse by unauthorized 
software.
✔ Hardware roots of trust.

Trusted Computing instead of

SE Android?

● Trusted Computing ≠ Secure Computing.

● Does not remove vulnerabilities in design or 

implementation.

● Provides a way to validate system assumptions for 

secure computing.
● Did the device boot the expected secure OS?
● Is the secure OS running in the expected state?

● Not a substitute for a secure OS.

● Able to leverage PC hardware primitives for 

virtualization and trusted computing.

● Including TPM, RTM, IOMMU capabilities.

● Directly transferred to laptops.
● Being leveraged in real solutions.

● Successfully ported to x86-based tablets.

SVP for ARM: Virtualization

● Leveraging OKL4 microvisor for para-

virtualization.

● Looking ahead to ARM virtualization 

extensions.

26

OKL4-based Architecture

27

Concerns with ARM 

virtualization

● Lack of mature, deployed virtualization 

solutions for ARM.

● Need for OEM cooperation.
● Frequent lack of IOMMU support.
● Static configuration of VMs.

 

28

SVP for ARM: Trusted 

Computing

● TrustZone as the likely foundation.
● Becoming more commonly available.
● Provides support for isolated execution and 

protected storage.

● Possible to tie to hardware root of trust.
● Possible place to host a MTM.

29

TrustZone

Source: www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/trustzone.php

30

Concerns with TrustZone
● No measured launch or attestation for secure 

monitor and secure world OS.

● Lack of widely available MTM implementations 

with standard APIs.

● Lack of / unclear state of separation of trusted 

applications.

● Lack of public details on many aspects of 

implementation important to security.

● Variability across hardware.

 

31

TrustZone instead of SE 

Android?

● Cannot address all security concerns of interest.
● Cannot protect data as it is being processed 

within the normal world.

● Similar to discussion of virtualization.
● Trying to address all security concerns via 

TrustZone will only lead to functional and API 
bloat, making it less secure.

● Also requires secure OS functionality for the 

secure world.

32

TrustZone instead of 

Virtualization?

● Only supports secure world vs non-secure 

world partitioning.

● Cannot support multiple VM architecture 

for security.

● Would likewise end up pushing too much 
functionality into TrustZone secure world.

33

TrustZone Correctly Applied
● Measured launch for normal world 

hypervisor and control plane.

● Provide MTM functionality.
● Safe place for runtime integrity monitoring 

of hypervisor.

● Protect the underpinnings of a system with 

virtualization and secure OS functionality.

Reaching the Goal

● Processor, SOC and device makers:

● Make virtualization and trusted computing primitives 

ubiquitously available.

● Enable use of virtualization and trusted computing by 

third party developers.

● Mobile platform developers:

● Include secure OS functionality.
● Leverage virtualization and trusted computing for 

security.

● Enable third party developers to leverage this 

functionality / extend to applications.

36

Avoiding the PC malware 

plague

● PC industry did not address these threats early.

● Plagued with malware as a result.
● Trapped in a quagmire of legacy / compatibility 

requirements.

● Don't make the same mistake for mobile devices.

● Device OEMs and mobile OS developers have an 

opportunity to do it right.

● Mobile device ecosystem makes it possible to still 

change.
