Low-end Embedded Devices 

■  Low cost, low power devices 
■  Built around a Micro-controller Unit 

(MCU) 
■  Limited: 
•  Memory 

–  4 KB Data Memory (SRAM) 
–  128KB Program Memory (Flash) 

•  Power 
•  computation capabilities 

■  For example 

•  MSP430 
•  AVR

Critical Cyber-physical Systems 

“A cyber-physical system 

(CPS) is a system where 
there is tight coordination of 
the system’s computational 
and physical elements, 
though sensors and 
actuators” 

3 

Why Security Now? 

■  Cyber-physical systems are built to be reliable 
■  Security was treated as an afterthought 
■  Acceptable with very limited connectivity 

And 

■  Ease of management is pushing wireless connectivity 

•  Implantable medical devices can be accessed via home readers through 

an RF channel 

•  In car systems are connected via wireless 

■  Indirectly connected to the Internet

Recent Attacks 
■  Stuxnet [1] 

•  Infected controlling windows machines 
•  Changed parameters of the PLC of the  
centrifuges of Iranian nuclear reactors 

■  Attacks against automotive controllers [2] 

•  Internal controller-area network (CAN) 
•  Exploiting one subsystem (e.g., bluetooth) 

allows access to critical subsystems (e.g., braking) 

■  Medical devices 

•  Insulin pumps hack [3] 
•  Implantable cardioverter defibrillator [4]

Remote Attestation 

Definitions 

■  Two party protocol between trusted verifier and untrusted prover 
■  Remotely verify the internal state of the prover 

Where 

■  Prover is the untrusted embedded device 
■  Verifier is the trusted reader/controller/base station 
■ 

Internal state is composed 
•  Code 
•  Registers 
•  Data Memory 
• 

I/O 

Two types of attestation: 

■  Secure Hardware supported (e.g., TPM) 
■  Software attestation 

•  Does not support multi-hop communication 

6 

Remote attestation 

■  Malicious software will lie about the software state of the prover 
■  Need to have guarantees that the device is not lying 

7 

SMART: Secure and Minimal Architecture for a 
Root of Trust 

Motivation: 

■  Existing solutions (TPM) are expensive for embedded devices 
■  What is a minimal set of architectural features to achieve remote 

attestation? 

Desirable features: 

■  Minimal modifications to existing platforms 

•  Fewest additional gates 

■  Security under a strong attacker model 
■  Portable to multiple platforms 

•  Implemented on AVR and MSP430 

8 

Security Goals 

Establish a dynamic root of trust on the prover 

■  “Guarantee untampered execution of a target piece of code, even 

in the presence of a corrupted platform” 

In particular 

■  Prover authentication 

•  Are we are talking with the right prover? 

■  External verification 

•  Do we know the internal state of the prover? 

■  Guaranteed execution 

•  Do we know the execution state? 

No tamper resistance/no hardware attacks 

9 

Great. How do we do that?

Building Blocks 

■  Secure Key Storage 
•  Required for multi-hop authentication 
•  Provides prover authentication 
■  Trusted ROM code memory region 
•  Read-only means integrity 
•  Accesses and operates on key 
■  MCU access controls 
•  Grants access to key to Trusted ROM 

11 

Key storage 
■  Provides remote prover authentication 
■  The key cannot be stored in normal memory 

•  Malware would steal it 

■  Need to protect key access 

Our approach 

■  Only a trusted code region can access the key

Trusted code region 

■  Low-end embedded devices do not have support for rings to restrict 

access to memory 

■  Adding those would require significant complexity 

Our approach 

■  Restrict access to a read-only trusted code region 
■  Access control can be implemented easily

Problems to solve 

Trusted ROM code and malware share the same resources 

■  Malware can set up the environment of the execution to 

compromise trusted code and extract the key 

■  Interrupts can asynchronously execute while a copy of the key is in 

main memory 

■  Malware can use code gadgets in ROM to access the key 

•  Return oriented programming 

■  ROM code might leave traces of the key in memory after execution 

16 

Counter Measures 

■  Atomic ROM code execution 

•  Enforce in hardware 
•  Enter at first instruction 
•  Exit at last instruction 

■  ROM code is instrumented to check for memory safety 

•  Upon detecting error reboot and clean memory 

■  Interrupts are disabled immediately 

•  Before key usage 

■  Erase key material before end of execution

Cost of adding ROM and access control 

■  Implemented on two common MCU platforms 

•  AVR 
•  MSP430 

19 

Considerations on SMART 

■  SMART provides an efficient hardware attestation solution for 

embedded devices 

■  Low additional gates required 
■  No run-time cost
